This poster was designed as part of a contest for the Middlesex Community College Theater Departmentâ€™s production of Romeo and Juliet. I chose to illustrate an hourglass to represent the limited amount of time Romeo and Juliet had with each other. Despite their short amount of time together, they still had an immense amount of love for one another, and this is depicted by the heart shape that is formed by their bodies. Rather than filling the hourglass with sand, I choose to fill it with blood in order to represent the death that occurs throughout the play. This poster was a runner up in the poster contest.
