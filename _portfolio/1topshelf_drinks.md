TopShelf Drinks is a concept for a progressive web app that myself and two friends built together. While we collaborated on features and functionality decisions, I had full creative freedom for branding and layout. The mockups for the design were created in Adobe InDesign and Illustrator. TopShlef drinks would allow users to create their own mixed drinks and use their smartphones to measure each ingredient. Users could also share and save drinks that others have created. TopShelf Drinks is an extension of the TopShelf brand, and you can find more under the TopShelf Pong section of my portfolio. Our website is currently under construction, and can be viewed at http://topshelf-pong.com/.
