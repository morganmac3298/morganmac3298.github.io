This series of small space ads has a fun way of presenting everyday problems that people may run into. My illustrations are designed to carry the viewer's eye through the layout, where they will find a brief paragraph that explains Bob’s services. This is followed by the slogan, and the logo. The logo is an outline of a lightbulb and in the filament are the words “Call Bob”, which is the solution to the problems presented in each header.
