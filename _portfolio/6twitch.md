Twitch is a video streaming site that is widely used to live stream video games. I was commissioned to design a series of assets for the user's profile. I started with the offline banner, this tells viewers when the streamer is not active (first). The profile banner remains static on the streamers page, this tells the viewers who they are and on which forms of social media they can be followed on (second). Lastly is the stream overlay, this forms a border around the live stream and displays the streamer's username (third).
