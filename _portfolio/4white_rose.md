White Rose is a florist company, I wanted their logo to feel classy and elegant. To accomplish this, I chose a beautiful serif font, and combined that with a hand drawn rose in a nice shade of ivory in between the two words. I wanted to continue the elegance from the logo throughout the stationery set, so I kept a clean layout and color scheme. These themes are continued in the pocket folder as well. This particular pocket folder for White Rose was designed to house information on wedding flowers, so the rose on the cover that is keeping the folder closed is meant to resemble a boutonniere. When the folder is opened, we'll see the letter of intent addressing the wedding planner that the folder was sent to, as well as an envelope, business card, and a few print outs of past work from White Rose. Their current promotional offers are on the back of each photo, one for bridal bouquets, centerpieces, and boutonnieres. On the back of the folder, their contact information can easily be found.
