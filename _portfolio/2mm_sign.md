Matchstick Marvels is a museum that displays sculptures made out of matchsticks. To recreate their logo, I used the two Ms from their name and used the negative space in between to suggest a matchstick shape. I chose a heavy typeface in order to represent the life size sculptures on display in the museum. My signage design shows what the logo would look like on a building. In the stationery set I continued with elements from the logo by bleeding a matchstick off the edge of the letterhead, as well as using an image of one of their sculptures on the front of the business card. Along with the stationery set, I designed an email blast. The promotion is geared towards kids, so I wanted to show the excitement of the museum by using an image of kids looking at one of the sculptures.
