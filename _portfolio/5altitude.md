During my internship with Altitude Trampoline Park, I was tasked with updating documents that are used throughout the park. This included gift bag forms, business cards, party sheets, and monthly specials. Along with the business card, I completed a full stationery set with two letterheads. By supervisor was interested in having options for when she wanted something professional, or something that felt playful like the atmosphere inside the park.

My favorite redesign that I completed during my internship was definitely the party sheet. Originally there were two separate sheets that were used for each party, the party sheet and the survey. On a busy weekend, Altitude could expect up to 20 parties in one day. That adds up to a lot of paper usage. I wanted to find a way to design an appealing layout that was easy to navigate, while combining the two separate documents. My design uses a half a page for each, and neatly categorizes the information needed from the party sheet, as well as providing a simple yet, descriptive survey for parents to complete after their party. This helped Altitude to have an easier time organizing party documents, and also cut their paper and ink use in half, thus saving them time and money.

While I was interning for Altitude, they switched their price menu from print, to TVs. I was tasked with redesigning the content that was being displayed. I chose to organize the information as two separate documents, rather than one, like the original that was too small for customers to read. Among solving their readability issues, I added some illustrations that feature Altitudeâ€™s mascot Spike, this made the menu feel more exciting and was now fun to look at. My supervisor was very pleased with the menu redesign, and will be sharing my designs with other Altitude locations.
