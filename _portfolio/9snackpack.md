Snack Pack is reusable packaging for kid’s lunches. I illustrated each letter in the logo as different foods that could be put in Snack Pack. Along with the logo, I designed characters to make Snack Pack easily recognizable, as well as more exciting to children. On the front of the Snack Pack packaging is SnackBot 1000, who is holding the sign where the child’s name can be written and wiped clean each day. On the left of the packaging is a sneak peek of SnackBot 2000, who is hiding on the inside of the wrapper. SnackBot 2000 is blank, so the kids can use markers or colored pencils to fill her in and draw or write on her sign. To go along with the full size Snack Pack, I designed a medium size, and a snack size.
