TopShelf Pong is a progressive web app that myself and two friends built together. While we collaborated on functionality decisions, I had full creative freedom for branding and layout. The mockups for the design were created in Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, and I coded the web app using HTML/CSS and some basic JavaScript. The app works by connecting a smartphone for each player (or controller) to an interactive scoreboard that would be displayed on a laptop or TV screen. The first five images are screenshots of the web app, followed by an image of our scoreboard. I've also included some examples of print material that I designed for TopShelf.  TopShelf Pong is an extension of the TopShelf brand, and you can find more under the TopShelf Drinks section of my portfolio. Our website is currently under construction, and can be viewed at http://topshelf-pong.com/.
